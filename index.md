# Kids Hack Day Wiki

**What is a Kids Hack Day**

Kids Hack Day is a global series of free creative tech events for kids. We give kids tools to express their creativity, be curious and empathetic towards each other and the world around them. We empower kids to take control over their own future and not just passively consume what someone else has designed for them.

**How to organize a Kids Hack Day in your city**

Kids Hack Day is an entirely free-to-attend and volunteer-organized event, created by and for the community.

1. Assemble your co-organizing team.

This could be a couple friends, or a number of people who represent different communities in your area (e.g. a hacker, a maker, an artist, an education enthusiast). When you begin planning, make sure to delegate different tasks to different people so that each person can help make progress along the way. Be sure to add your city and contact details to the Kids Hack Day wiki.

2. Lock down a venue and a date.

This is the most vital step into making your event happen. Once you have a venue and a date, it’s easier to find sponsors, get plans in place, keep helpers motivated and iron out the logistics. Remember that you’re looking for a venue that is willing to donate their space for free (in exchange for top sponsorship). I’ve found that offices you or your friends work at are typically the best places to begin asking around – they’re usually shut down on weekends, they already have chairs/wifi, and are happy to welcome events that value collaboration between different types of people.

3. Find sponsors.

Ideally you’ve given yourself a few months before the event is set to take place. Once you’ve secured your venue/date, the immediate next step is to begin reaching out to potential sponsors. Ask companies, non-profits, startups, etc. in your area if they’re interested in helping support this volunteer-run, free-to-attend event. Don’t be nervous and don’t worry if you get rejected a few times – some companies are setup to regularly give away sponsorship and others are not. Enlist the help of your friends to get the word out about your event needing sponsorship.

4. Organize your budget and logistics.

Kids Hack Day is a free-to-attend event. Look at the amount of sponsorship you’re bringing in and begin getting quotes on food (if you are giving some) so that you can set a budget. You’ll ideally want a bit of leftover money for any additional needs (office supplies, renting tables, silly prizes, etc.). Next, begin laying out the schedule for the event (including your set-up & clean-up time).  Kids Hack Day is about doing, not talking. You will need resources that attendees can use for their hacks (quirkbots, kano, littlebits, arduinos, 3d printers, electronics, cardboard, etc.). 

5. Open up registration.

I personally recommend using Eventbrite. You should ask attendees to register to attend, but remember to keep the event free (i.e. don’t charge money for tickets). As part of the registration process, ask your attendees to identify who they are and whoe their parents are. Be sure to email the attendees at least 2 times before the event giving them all the details they need to know and encouraging them to begin brainstorming. Bonus points: Before/during registration, curate a list of super awesome and DIVERSE people you’d love to attend your event and send them personal invitations – this is the best way to create a diverse event (e.g. if you’re worried about the event being male-dominated, send personal invitations to a long list of women). Personal invitations are always appreciated and help others know that their unique background is valued at the event.

6. Prepare for the event

Since Kids will be playing with tools you have to make parents sign a Release Form. Also make sure you have an scheadule of activities and all the necessary materials.
