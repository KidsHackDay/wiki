### Report
All the 4 girls really got into the Kano's after some struggling of finding the right keyboards. Each bluetooth module is uniquely mapped to one keyboard. So we've now started marking the keyboards and bluetooth modules with numbers (author: Carl). Some girls also built some pads for the twister game.

### Report
We now have 4 screens all connected to Kano's and they all work perfectly. Susanne setup her Kano and some kids created their own accounts. I made sure that if a kid created his/her own account that they would mark the computer with their name so that they could continue building their games, finding the right coputer that has their account stored (author: Carl)
