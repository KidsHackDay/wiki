Report
We divided the girls into pairs and todays task was to construct an insect-crawler with two servos, an sonarsensor and an arduinoboard. They got really into it and next time we'll continue the project and code the insects. All were involved in problemsolving togeher. Vivi taught us a really cool easy cryptho, let's see if someone in the other groups will be able to break it!

We also had a 20 minutes break in the middle of the club, really god thing to get a bit of rest for all the kids. They have a lot easier to focus if they all get a break together during the club.
