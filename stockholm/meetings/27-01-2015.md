# Meeting 27-01-2015

## Agenda

* Celebrate our awesome friend Isabella for the amazing work in 2014! <3
* Club days
* Minecraft
* Projects repository

## Discussion

### Celebrate
Done! Fireworks included.

### Club days

Monday to Wednesday.

### Minecraft

Murilo proposal is to skip the Minecraft scripting as it was last club and replace it with Kano's challenges. Instead of having it as part of club it could be a week of course or weekly sessions with 3-5 kids.
If we have a class, Murilo will give a introduction workshop so anyone can be a Minecraft monitor.
There is an interest on giving this introduction workshop or some sessions to Colombia's kids.

### Projects repository

We'll be using [http://khdprojects.pythonanywhere.com](http://khdprojects.pythonanywhere.com) instead of the previous wiki since this new one has category and search. 

## To Do

* Scope for the Minecraft Academy (Murilo)
* Create a sign up email/page/form for Minecraft Academy
* Create user for everybody on the new Project repository (Simon)
* Write instructions on how to use the Github process wiki (Murilo)
